    <p>Hi everyone!<br>
    Iâ€™m Shansar â€” your future best friend! ðŸŒŸ  
    Every day, I share my mistakes, lessons, and growth. My goal is to help you see that small mistakes help us improve â€” so we can become better together!
    </p>
    <p>Hi everyone! Today was a good day. I woke up at 6 AM as usual and went to Brahma Kumaris (Om Shanti). After that, I did my homework. Once I finished, I watched a bit of videos on my phone, then started my work. I did some coding, played Minecraft, and in the evening I went back to Om Shanti for my course. It was a lot of fun! I learned many new things and we laughed a lot. Later in the evening, I played games, worked on my blog page, and finally went to sleep. Thatâ€™s all for today â€” see you all tomorrow!</p>
    <p>âœ¨ <strong>Motive:</strong> Grow together, shine together!</p>
